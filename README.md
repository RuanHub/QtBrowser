# Qt Browser

Welcome to the Qt Browser project! This project is an exploration into creating a basic web browser using Qt 6.7.2 and the `webview` module.

## Overview

The Qt Browser is a simple application that leverages the Qt framework to render web content. This project is intended as a learning tool to familiarize oneself with Qt's webview capabilities and to demonstrate the integration of web technologies within a Qt application.

## Features

- **Basic Web Navigation**: Load and display web pages using the Qt WebEngine.
- **Minimal UI**: A simple user interface to interact with web content.

## Prerequisites
- Qt 6.7.2
- Qt WebEngine module (part of the Qt package)

## Important
- Make sure to use MSVC because MINGW doesn't support chromium
